# Sudoku

This is a fully functioning Haskell program for solving Sudoku puzzles.
I made this after getting into an argument with someone who claimed that a depth first search algorithm wouldn't solve a Sudoku puzzle in a reasonable amount of time.
I think this program successfully proves them wrong!


Currently, puzzles need to be manually entered within the source code of app/Main.hs.
Two puzzles are currentlty typed out, so it should be clear how to add new ones.

Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions!

# TODO

It would be nice to allow the program to accept puzzles from stdin or on the command line.
However, as it stands, I've already spent nearly as much time on the pretty print code than on the solver itself, so I don't really intend to implement this any time soon.
